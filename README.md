Here are three papers written on the topic of AI and data ethics.

Explainability of Black Box Models:

In this paper I discuss what it means to be able to explain the decisions made by a machine learning algorithm 
and review some of the current methods of making these algorithms explainable.

Ethical Implications behind Synthetic Data:

In this paper I discuss the use of AI generated data in training machine learning algorithms. I take a look at 
how synthetic data is currently being used and whether or not its use is ethical.

The Extended Mind, Internet, and Augmented Reality:

In this paper I discuss the extended mind thesis and argue why I believe that Augmented Reality is the strongest way 
to extend the mind.
